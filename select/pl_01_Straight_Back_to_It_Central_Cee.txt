(You are now listening
to Young Chencs)
Always remember that, bro
When you was sleepin' on trains,
and you're homeless
And your mums kicked you out
and all them ting there?
People would've loved
to shit on you
So now that you're doing
your ting and you're gwarning,
stay cooking
Done a graveyard shift
last night,
woke up today and got–
Got straight back to it
Done a graveyard shift
last night
Woke up today
and got straight back to it
Took me an L, no problem
I got on my grind,
got straight back to it
(Back to it)
Had to handle a call
in the middle of jeetin'
I put down my phone,
got straight back to it
They freed my bro,
got straight back to it
Bro-bro fresh home,
got straight back to it
(Back to it)

Look,
we all go through hard times
That's why it's "Live Yours"
and it's not "Live Mine"
You gotta turn up sometimes,
live life
You gotta work hard or
you're not gon' shine
Told the promoter
"I'm not performin'
if I can't come with all
of the guys"
I got the ball right now,
it's my time
But I told bro-bro,
"Go long, go wide"
They shot their shot
but it was offside
It's from Virgil
when I rock Off-White
No cap, this shit ain't
no made up rhymes
Got a way with words,
got away with crimes
Told lil' bro,
"You're the next in line
But be patient,
it'll take some time"
Don't think 'cah we ain't
got back just yet
That we just gon' let it slide
(Slide)

I thought this shit was Hip-Hop?
Not gonna lie,
I'm a bit disappointed
Certain man wanna move
like divas
What can I say?
It's for entertainment
I fucked shawty,
and I left her high and dry
It's deep,
she thought I was stayin'
Fuck,
I just lived up to the
stereotype that we're
all the same, shame
Uh, she wanna get slapped
in the face, uh
I'm afraid it's a bit too kinky,
and I'm not tryna
catch me a case
Say what I want,
you don't have to relate
Unlike most of these artists
that's lyin', I'm actually paid
I don't want aftermarket
diamonds, man,
I want factory made
OGs need to get back to reality
I don't wanna hear 'bout back
in the day
Go on the 'net, all I hear is
"Cench"
I don't wanna hear them chattin'
my name
All of these guys
try cat the campaign
I feel like Usher,
I trap in the rain
Been through a lot,
I can handle the fame
I waste no time gettin'
straight back to it
(Back to it, back to it)
You need to remember,
brother, yeah
First they love you,
then they hate you
Then love you again
(Waste no time,
get straight back to it)
When you come out you're hot,
you're hot, you're new
You know you can't do no wrong
You're new, you're golden boy
And then they start
tryna slowly find chinks
in your armour
And things to tear you down
Done a graveyard
